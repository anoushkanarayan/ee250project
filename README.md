# ee250project

Team Members: Shreya Parikh and Anoushka Narayan

How to Compile:
On the RPi, cd to ee250code folder and run 'sudo python3 grovepicode.py'.
Select your date on the RPi and you should see the Flask application begin in the terminal.
Go to Mozilla Firfox on VM and go to http://172.20.10.8:5000 to see the website with the updated guide (sub with IP address of your RPi if necessary).

We used the Jinja templating engine to update our HTML file as well as the Flask framework and the TVmaze API.
